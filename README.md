#[2022.05.05] 1=1 token0,1,2 genesis

Thank you 🙏 for taking a few minutes to watch and read. Please feel free to share with your network. 

There was a time I was nominated for the Social Corporate Responsibility Board of a firm for giving time, talent, and treasure to RobinHood Foundation, KIPP, New Museum, and United Way. For example, today 
giving as KIPP NYC Associate Council Member, I would have typically attended Glenview Capitals' annual Casino Night benefiting KIPP NYC. 

Today, I am humble and ask for your help. Today, I am indigent, poor, broke, and the details of why are a matter for another time. Hint: NDA; cost to society, so even if I wanted, I can't speak. I struggle with asking anyone for help because I am proud, independent, skilled, and capable of work. Yet, life has not flowed any forward. 

In 2017, I incorporated in Florida, ArtCoVest. The idea was too early as an entrepreneurship venture. Blockchain provenance of physical art fractionalized, co-owned, providing access to masses to be Fine Art Collectors.  

In 2021, I assessed that the time for COURAGE was NOW. ArtCoVest evolved into @ETHGlobal #HackMoney dotkittyskull.eth/ownyou.eth and #HackFS yasss.eth [https://alejandra-m-salaverria.com/] Ever since, the drag of 2017 has taken a different form. There is much I hope gets revealed to me, for now I keep adding days; for example, today is May05.d232+~331. My life has frozen in time. 

Humbly (and I will lie if not to state ashamed and embarrassed), I am asking for your help to buy a Casino Night Poker Ship valued at $1,000 each. You will help me keep the lights on by temporarily preventing condo foreclosure and homelessness by purchasing a token. 

Given my current financial demise, today, I scribe the contract via @opensea and @polygon (I don't have funds for gas to mint on @Ethereum). That said, as committed on video recording, upon sale, I will:
mint physical token as NFT on Ethereum blockchain
deliver physical token 
donate 10% to KIPP
In addition, I invite you to join me on the journey to nextEraBuild 1=1 ONE_EQUAL_ONE; get readyPlayer1.

I anticipate you may need time to think and probably have a few questions. There is a lot to unpack in this short video and manuscript. I am happy to connect. My contact information is: allyalejandra@pm.me
